There is a period in a school life, when one has to learn the multiplication table. My son was not an exception and did not avoid the fate.

We began to study the table the same old way: turned a notebook and started to learn.
Obviously this is a boring way, which went out of date. First of all it requires parents’ patience: it is difficult to test the own child for knowledge of the table several times a day. Sometimes there is simply not time for this. 
It was easy for me to find the decision of the problem- to write a trainer, which will make the learning of the table more interesting for a child. The set of options will be the cannon balls. The number of correct answers will be a shot at a pirate. If you think for a long time, then the pirate shoots at you. Apparently the phrases like ”Dad, today I shot a pirate at a complicates level" are better than dull phrases “Today I learned the multiplication table till 5”.

Advantages:
-Two kinds of arithmetic operations: multiplication and division
-A built-in multiplication table for learning
-3 levels of the level of complexity(the speed of shooting at pirate is raising or lowering)
-Two types for answer entering: by figures and by multiple choice
-The history of already played games can be saved in order to trace the progress
-The possibility to choose the range of the derived equations
